# Introduction

`r newthought('No question occurs without a context')` or an origin story. Typically, in philosophy questions like "What is the answer to " and "how do I know that I am right" are considered? This question will focus on the epistemological challenge of the later. This issue has been the focus of philosophers (Descartes) and non-philosophers (Trump) for many centuries. 

@Descartes1641 denied the relevance of sense data and only believed in the reality of his cognition. Arguing that he could be asleep and in a dream without the ability to distinguish this state from waking and perceiving. Instead, he claimed that it was the reality of God which enabled him to be sure he was right.  [@Descartes1641]
